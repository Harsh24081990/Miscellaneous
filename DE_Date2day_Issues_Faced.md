If you haven’t worked directly in prod, you need **practical but safe examples** that every data engineer faces, especially in **ADF + Databricks with Medallion architecture**. Here’s a set you can always mention:

---

### 🔹 Common Production Issues You Can Confidently Talk About

1. **Data quality issues (very common)**

   * Source file missing columns, wrong schema, or NULLs in key columns.
   * Handled by adding schema validation, `badRecordsPath`, and filtering NULLs before writing to Silver layer.

2. **File arrival/availability issues**

   * Files not delivered on time from source systems → pipeline fails at the copy activity.
   * Handled by adding retry logic, alerts in ADF, and “wait”/“until” activities.

3. **Cluster / performance issues**

   * Spark jobs running slow or failing due to shuffle size, skewed data, or partitions.
   * Resolved by tuning `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`, repartitioning data, or caching intermediate DataFrames.

4. **Connectivity & credential issues**

   * Service Principal / Managed Identity access expired or permissions revoked → pipeline fails to connect to ADLS/SQL.
   * Fixed by re-validating Azure Key Vault secrets or reassigning RBAC roles.

5. **ADF orchestration failures**

   * Notebook activity fails but pipeline doesn’t stop → added proper error handling with “Fail Activity” and pipeline alerts.
   * Used custom logging to capture notebook exit codes in ADF.

6. **Schema evolution issues**

   * New columns added in source unexpectedly.
   * Resolved by using Delta Lake schema evolution (`mergeSchema` option) in Silver layer and documenting changes before promoting to Gold.

7. **Data duplication issues**

   * Same file reprocessed multiple times → duplicate records in Silver.
   * Handled by enabling Delta Lake’s `MERGE` or using unique file tracking (watermark tables).

### 🔹 How you can frame it in interview

👉 “In my current project, we use ADF for orchestration and Databricks notebooks for transformations in a medallion architecture.
Some common failures I’ve handled are: missing or corrupted source files, schema mismatches, and connectivity issues with ADLS/SQL.
On Databricks side, jobs sometimes failed due to skewed data or shuffle issues, which we solved by partition tuning and caching.
We also had challenges with schema evolution and duplicate data, where we used Delta features like schema merge and MERGE for upserts.”

💬 **Answer Script**

“In my current project, we use **ADF for orchestration** and **Databricks notebooks for data transformations**, following the **medallion architecture**.

In production, I’ve seen different types of failures. A common one is **data quality issues** – for example, source files arriving with missing columns, NULLs in key fields, or bad records. We handle this by validating schema at the Bronze layer and redirecting bad records using `badRecordsPath`.

Another frequent issue is **file availability**. Sometimes source systems don’t deliver files on time, which causes ADF copy activity to fail. We set up retry logic and alerts in ADF to catch this early.

I’ve also handled **connectivity and credential issues**, like expired secrets or permission revokes for ADLS/SQL, which we resolved using Managed Identity and Key Vault.

On the Databricks side, **performance and job failures** happen due to skewed data or high shuffle size. We mitigated those with partition tuning (`spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`), repartitioning, and caching intermediate DataFrames.

Finally, **schema evolution and duplicate data** are also common. For schema changes, we used **Delta Lake schema evolution** (`mergeSchema`), and for duplicate handling we used **Delta MERGE** logic to keep data clean.

So, overall I would say most issues I’ve handled are around **data quality, availability, connectivity, and performance tuning**, and we always build proper monitoring and alerting in ADF to ensure smooth runs.”


👉 This way, you cover **real-world scenarios** (data quality, availability, credentials, performance, schema evolution) without sounding fake or bookish.

----------
👍 Here are **3 ready-made examples** you can use in interviews.
Keep them short → **Issue → Impact → Resolution**

---

### ✅ **Example 1: File Schema Mismatch**

**Issue:** Source file arrived with extra columns not in target schema.
**Impact:** Spark job failed in Silver layer.
**Resolution:** Implemented schema evolution in Delta (`mergeSchema = true`) and redirected malformed records to `badRecordsPath`. This ensured pipeline didn’t stop and we captured the new columns.

---

### ✅ **Example 2: Missing Source Files**

**Issue:** Daily file from upstream didn’t arrive on time.
**Impact:** ADF pipeline failed, breaking the SLA.
**Resolution:** Added a pre-check step in ADF (Get Metadata activity) to validate file existence, added retry with delay, and configured alerting via Logic Apps. This reduced false job failures.

---

### ✅ **Example 3: OutOfMemory / Slow Job**

**Issue:** Databricks job processing a large join ran for hours and finally failed with memory error.
**Impact:** Delay in Gold layer reporting tables.
**Resolution:** Optimized Spark job by adjusting `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`, used broadcast join for smaller table, and repartitioned skewed column. The job ran 70% faster after optimization.

---

👉 If they ask **“What do you do when a job fails in production?”** you can confidently say:

* First, check ADF monitor/logs to identify which activity failed.
* Then review Databricks job logs for error type (data issue, schema mismatch, performance, permissions, etc.).
* Depending on issue, either re-run after fix, or apply hotfix (e.g., dropping bad rows, adjusting cluster config, restarting pipeline).
