### AVRO VS PARQUEST file format

Both Avro and Parquet are popular file formats used in big data processing, particularly in environments like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark. They each have unique features, strengths, and ideal use cases. Here’s a comparison of the two:

### Avro

#### Features:
- **Row-Oriented**: Avro is a row-based storage format, making it suitable for transactional data where you often need to read/write whole records.
- **Schema Evolution**: Avro stores the schema alongside the data, allowing for easy schema evolution (adding or removing fields).
- **Compression**: Avro supports various compression algorithms, making it efficient in terms of storage.
- **Binary Format**: It uses a compact binary format, which reduces storage space and improves I/O performance.
- **Interoperability**: It is language-agnostic, with libraries available in many programming languages.

#### Use Cases:
- **Streaming Data**: Avro is often used in streaming applications (e.g., Apache Kafka) where the focus is on processing records as they come in.
- **Data Serialization**: It’s commonly used for data serialization in applications that require compact binary formats for high performance.
- **Data Warehousing**: Suitable for scenarios where data needs to be frequently updated or where the schema may change over time.

### Parquet

#### Features:
- **Column-Oriented**: Parquet is a columnar storage format, making it highly efficient for analytical queries that read only a few columns from a large dataset.
- **Efficient Compression**: Parquet supports different compression algorithms and optimizes for better compression ratios, especially for similar data types.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: It allows for more efficient data processing by enabling predicate pushdown, where queries can skip reading entire columns based on filter conditions.
- **Schema Support**: Parquet also supports schema evolution, though it’s not as flexible as Avro in terms of handling complex schema changes.

#### Use Cases:
- **Data Analytics**: Parquet is ideal for analytics workloads in data lakes or data warehouses where read performance is crucial.
- **Big Data Processing**: Used in systems like Apache Spark and Hive for efficient querying of large datasets.
- **Reporting and BI Tools**: Frequently used in conjunction with business intelligence tools that need to perform complex queries on large datasets.

### Summary of Differences

| Feature          | Avro                                | Parquet                            |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Storage Format    | Row-oriented                        | Column-oriented                     |
| Schema Handling   | Schema stored with data; flexible   | Schema evolution supported          |
| Compression       | Supports various algorithms          | Optimized for columnar data        |
| Use Cases         | Streaming, data serialization       | Data analytics, reporting           |
| Performance       | Better for write-heavy workloads    | Better for read-heavy workloads     |

### Conclusion

- **Choose Avro** when your use case involves streaming data, frequent updates, or scenarios requiring schema evolution.
- **Choose Parquet** when your primary need is efficient data analytics and read performance, especially for large datasets where you want to query specific columns. 
-------------------------------------------------------------
Both formats are in binary format and not in human readable format.
To see the parquest file data we can convert it into readable datafram using pandas. 
```python
import pandas as pd

# Read a Parquet file into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_parquet('data.parquet')

# Display the DataFrame
print(df)
```
