Avro, Parquet, and ORC are popular columnar data storage formats used in big data processing. Each has its own strengths and use cases. Here’s a breakdown of the differences:

### 1. Avro
- **Format Type**: Row-based format.
- **Schema**: Uses JSON for schema definition and stores the schema with the data, allowing for easy data serialization and deserialization.
- **Compression**: Supports various compression codecs like Deflate and Snappy.
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Best suited for scenarios where data needs to be read and written in a row-oriented manner, such as logging or event streaming.
  - Ideal for data interchange between systems due to its rich data types and schema evolution support.
- **Performance**: Generally slower for analytical queries compared to columnar formats like Parquet and ORC.

### 2. Parquet
- **Format Type**: Columnar format.
- **Schema**: Uses a binary format for schema definition, allowing for complex nested data structures.
- **Compression**: Supports efficient compression and encoding schemes (e.g., Snappy, Gzip).
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Optimized for read-heavy analytical workloads, making it suitable for big data processing frameworks like Apache Spark and Hive.
  - Ideal for scenarios where queries often involve a subset of columns.
- **Performance**: Offers faster query performance for analytical workloads due to its columnar nature and efficient compression.

### 3. ORC (Optimized Row Columnar)
- **Format Type**: Columnar format.
- **Schema**: Stores schema information within the file, allowing for complex data types.
- **Compression**: Uses lightweight compression, often yielding smaller file sizes than Avro.
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Primarily used with Hadoop ecosystems and works well with Hive and Spark.
  - Excellent for complex queries and large datasets, especially where aggregations are common.
- **Performance**: Generally provides excellent performance for read operations and is well-suited for data warehousing scenarios.

### Summary
- **Avro**: Best for row-based operations and data interchange; supports schema evolution but is not as efficient for analytical queries.
- **Parquet**: Optimized for analytical queries, supporting columnar storage and efficient compression; widely used in big data frameworks.
- **ORC**: Similar to Parquet but optimized for Hive and Hadoop; excels in complex queries and data warehousing.

Choosing between these formats depends on your specific use case, data access patterns, and the technologies you’re using.

### Conclusion

- **Choose Avro** when your use case involves streaming data, frequent updates, or scenarios requiring schema evolution.
- **Choose Parquet** when your primary need is efficient data analytics and read performance, especially for large datasets where you want to query specific columns.
- **ORC**: Similar to Parquet but optimized for Hive and Hadoop; excels in complex queries and data warehousing.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Both formats are in binary format and not in human readable format.
To see the parquest file data we can convert it into readable datafram using pandas. 
```python
import pandas as pd

# Read a Parquet file into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_parquet('data.parquet')

# Display the DataFrame
print(df)
```
