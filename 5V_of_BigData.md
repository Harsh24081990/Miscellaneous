5 V's of Big Data 


It help us understand the unique nature of large-scale data.


1. Volume: 

This refers to the sheer amount of data. 

Big data involves handling massive quantities of information, often exceeding what traditional systems can manage. 

Imagine it as the data equivalent of an overflowing river. For instance, in 2016, global mobile traffic reached a staggering 6.2 exabytes (6.2 billion gigabytes) per month, and by 2020, we have nearly 64.2 zettabytes of data & It will increase exponentially in future.



2. Velocity: 

Velocity represents the speed at which data is generated, processed, and transformed into insights. 

With the advent of smart devices, social media, and sensors, data flows in rapidly—like a high-speed train hurtling down the tracks. 

For instance, Google handles over 3.5 billion searches per day, and Facebook's user base grows by approximately 22% each year.



3. Variety: 

Big data isn't just about structured tables and neat rows. 

It includes diverse data types: structured, semi-structured, and unstructured. Imagine a colorful mosaic of information—text, images, videos, sensor readings, and more. 

Structured data adheres to a defined format, semi-structured data is less organized (like log files), and unstructured data (such as texts, pictures, and videos) doesn't fit neatly into traditional database structures.



4. Veracity: 

Veracity refers to inconsistencies and uncertainty in data. 

Sometimes data can get messy, and ensuring quality and accuracy becomes challenging. Big data is also variable due to the multitude of data dimensions resulting from disparate data types and sources. 

For example, bulk data could create confusion, while insufficient data might convey incomplete information.



5. Value: 

After considering the first four V's, we arrive at the crucial aspect of value. Data, in itself, holds no significance—it needs to be converted into something valuable to extract meaningful information. 

Companies strive to turn big data into actionable insights that drive decisions and create value.



So, the 5 V's—Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity, and Value—shape the landscape of big data.
