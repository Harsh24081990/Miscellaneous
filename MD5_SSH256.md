### What is MD?
**MD** typically refers to **Message Digest** and is often associated with MD5, which is an older cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit hash value. Like SHA-256, it takes an input and produces a fixed-size hash, but it is less secure than SHA-256 due to vulnerabilities that allow for collisions (two different inputs producing the same hash).

### What is SHA-256?
**SHA-256** stands for **Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit**. It is part of the SHA-2 family of cryptographic hash functions designed by the National Security Agency (NSA). SHA-256 generates a fixed-size 256-bit (32-byte) hash value from input data, which makes it a commonly used algorithm for data integrity and security applications.

### Benefits of Using SHA-256
- **Collision Resistance**: SHA-256 is less likely to produce hash collisions compared to MD5, making it a safer choice for critical applications.
- **Consistency**: You can easily track changes over time, ensuring that historical records are maintained accurately.
