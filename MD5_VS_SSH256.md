### Benefits of Using MD5
-Reduced Comparison Complexity: Instead of comparing 10 columns individually, you only need to compare one hash value. This simplifies the logic and can reduce processing time.
-Performance Improvement: Hashing functions like MD5 are generally efficient and can lead to improved performance, especially when dealing with large datasets. Instead of checking each column, you can quickly check the hash value.
-Easier Maintenance: Using a hash can make your code cleaner and easier to maintain. If you need to add more columns in the future, you just update the hashing function rather than modifying multiple comparisons.

#### Considerations
- Hash Collisions: Although rare, there is a possibility of hash collisions (two different inputs producing the same hash). If data integrity is crucial, ensure that your use case can tolerate this risk or consider using a more collision-resistant hashing algorithm like SHA-256.
- Overhead of Hashing: There is some computational overhead in generating the hash itself, but this is generally offset by the savings in comparison time.

### What is MD?
**MD** typically refers to **Message Digest** and is often associated with MD5, which is an older cryptographic hash function that produces a **128-bit hash value.** Like SHA-256, it takes an input and produces a fixed-size hash, but it is less secure than SHA-256 due to vulnerabilities that allow for collisions (two different inputs producing the same hash).

### What is SHA-256?
**SHA-256** stands for **Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit**. It is part of the SHA-2 family of cryptographic hash functions designed by the National Security Agency (NSA). SHA-256 generates a **fixed-size 256-bit (32-byte) hash value** from input data, which makes it a commonly used algorithm for data integrity and security applications.

### Benefits of Using SHA-256
- **Collision Resistance**: SHA-256 is less likely to produce hash collisions compared to MD5, making it a safer choice for critical applications.
- **Consistency**: You can easily track changes over time, ensuring that historical records are maintained accurately.
